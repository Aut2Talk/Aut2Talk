# Aut2Talk
Aut2Talk is a mobile application supported on both iOS and Android devices that is used to help people on the autism spectrum communicate with others. Users are able to set up buttons for anything they want to communicate, like certain emotions, needs, or activities. Once a button is pressed, a corresponding video is shown to try to help them express themselves and their needs. 

The buttons are all customizable so that the application is generic enough to be used by a variety of people. It also allows you to record their own videos that are played back when a button is pressed.

Aut2Talk was originally created for the TOM (Tikkun Olam Makers) 72-hour makeathon in 2017, which aims to use technology to meet the neglected needs of people living with disabilities.
